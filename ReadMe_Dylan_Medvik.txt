Created, but did not fully implement a interactive calendar that allows date selection, adding notes to dates, and a table displaying upcoming events within 14 days.
Calendar intent was to be interactive for Admin/Owner accounts as to set schedules and then display a static version to Stylists so they are aware of events.
